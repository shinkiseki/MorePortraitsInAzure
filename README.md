## Installation instructions
1.  Download the latest release of More Portraits in Azure. This should include a data folder.
2.  Identify the folder where the Steam (or GOG) edition of Trails to Azure lives. Within this folder, there should be, among other files, the game itself (ao.exe) and a data folder. This is the __root folder__ of the game.
3.  Drag the mod's data folder into the root folder. This will copy all the mod files into the root folder, placing all files into the correct subfolders. Please note that this will replace some of the original scena (scenario) files.
4. (Optional) There is an option to also install improved versions of the vanilla portraits (see below for comparisons). These are in a separate download called Improved Vanilla Portraits. In this release is another data folder. Drag this data folder into the root folder. This will copy all the improved portraits into the root folder. Please note that this will replace the original portrait files.
5.  The mod has now been installed! New portraits will now be shown in-game. This will work for English and Japanese scripts! 英語も日本語もOKです！
6.  To uninstall the mod, verify integrity of game files. This will revert all scena files back to normal. Note that the added portraits will not be removed; these will not impact your gameplay.
	*   On Steam, right-click the game in the Steam client, then select Properties -> Local Files -> Verify integrity of game files.
	*   On GOG, click on the game in the GOG client, then select More -> Manage Installation -> Verify/Repair -> VERIFY GAME.

## List of added characters
Completed characters in **bold**. Characters not previously included in the [Geofront version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2iGFyWjqRI) of this mod are labeled as new.

*   **Chaco (2/2)**

*   **Wenzel (8/8)**
*   **Lynn (9/9)**
*   **Aeolia (11/11)**
*   **Pierre (8/8)**

*   Note: Douglas wears a special outfit not present in Akatsuki no Kiseki for a few scenes in Azure. As such, he will not have portraits in those scenes, so as to not show him wearing the wrong outfit in his portraits.
*   Note: Duvalie was previously included as part of Akatsuki Portraits in Azure. However, she has portraits by default as part of the NISA release of Azure. Because of this, the More Portraits in Azure mod does not include any changes to Duvalie.

## Other features

## Reporting issues
If there is a bug encountered over the course of using this mod, I would appreciate being notified so that I may make the proper fixes.

For those comfortable with GitHub, please report any issues. The most helpful way to report an issue is to provide a screenshot and note when/where this is occurring. This will help identify the issue, then test that the issue has been resolved.

GitHub not your style? Feel free to message me via Reddit or Twitter. I am also around on Discord via several Falcom-related servers, including The Geofront.

For those using GitHub, please report these (or other) issues if they are discovered (once the issue is reported, I will label the issue accordingly):
*   **[Text]** There are typos, missing dialogue, or some other issue with the text. Pretty self-explanatory. While the primary focus is on text issues created by the mod itself, typos from the original game are also okay to report.
*   **[Portrait]** The wrong character portrait is used. This might be that the wrong character's portrait is appearing, or the right character has an expression inappropriate for their dialogue. The latter may be subjective to an extent, but feedback is always welcome.
*   **[Portrait]** The character might be missing a portrait altogether. This may be intentional (characters off-screen do not have portraits, for instance), but for the most part, the supported characters should have portraits.
*   **[Text box]** The text box may close and reopen between lines of dialogue, instead of remaining open. For characters without portraits, each line of dialogue creates a new text box; in other words, after each line, the text box closes, and another one opens to display the next line. For characters with portraits, this is different; a single text box opens for the entire set of dialogue, only closing after the last line. As part of the mod, the intent is for characters with added portraits to have their text boxes stay open for their entire dialogue.
*   **[Text box]** The text box size looks weird. As noted with the previous point, a single text box opens for an entire set of dialogue, rather than a new text box for each line. The text box will be long enough to accommodate the longest line of text; consequently, shorter lines of text may look weird. To an extent, this can be addressed by shifting words around to make each line approximately the same length, thus better filling out the text box.
*   **[Non-text box bug]** While unlikely, it's possible that the mod introduces some game-impacting bug.
*   **[Misc.]** There's probably something I've forgotten to list--let me know and I'll sort it out.
